* reason
i have a hard time choosing a framework/technology, therefore decided to explore realworld.
- old ones are boring
- new ones are promising but rough around the edges
- the balance between widespread usage, adoptation, features & performance is difficult to find.
* enter realworld.io
- a good resource of arguably non-trivial reference implementations of the same functionality.
* what we'd like to compare
- code readability. subjective!
- terseness. lines of code
- reasonable extensibility, feature-wise
  - integration to 3rd party services
  - ease of development with client-side
- dogma. functional vs. procedure
- ease of development
  - hot reaload, built in debugger
* approach
- tests are excluded for loc comparison. more "static" and "pure" languages arguably require less tests, as compilation provides some of that.

* what's compared
- server side implementations list :: [[file:server-side-repos.txt][server-side-repos.txt]]
- client side implementations list :: [[file:client-side-repos.txt][client-side-repos.txt]]
* installation
- install cloc :: $ npm install
- clone server repos :: $ ./fetch.sh server
- clone client repos :: $ ./fetch.sh client
* usage
- analyze fetched server side implementations :: $ ./cloc.sh server
- analyze fetched client side implementations :: $ ./cloc.sh client
cloc results are put into [[file:client-results/][client-results/]] and [[file:server-results/][server-results/]], respectively.
