* reason
i have a hard time choosing a framework/technology, therefore decided to explore realworld.
- old ones are boring
- new ones are promising but rough around the edges
- the balance between widespread usage, adoptation, features & performance is difficult to find.
* enter realworld.io
- a good resource of arguably non-trivial reference implementations of the same functionality.
* what we'd like to compare
- terseness. lines of code
